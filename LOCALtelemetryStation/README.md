# esp32GPS
I've been wanting to learn about more hardwware+software applications, so I stumbled upon making a telemetry circuit that posts to Geolinker API. I also wanted to create a network of  GPS, so I will also make a similar circuit in Germany and use these for more projects in the future

# Geolinker API was buggy so I removed it from the code


as shown, the mqtt is functionall, and it sends the temp and hum data from the dht22 and the coordinate data from the neo 7m gps module
