# IOT HUB

I have always wanting to explore and test Hmoe automation. This is my way of starting. I aim build, grow and mantain a local system with various things talking to my, a Raspberry Pi 5 my friends and family gave me as a birthday present. I want this various mini projects to then connect to the rpi which will then use the data received as callable APIs or as objects in interactive web apps. In many ways, I want to create a System in my room to then, eventually, monitor and share even not in my room.
